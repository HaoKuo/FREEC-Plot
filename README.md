# FREEC-Plot
Plotting outputs of Control-FREEC for targeting sequencing data


    Example: Rscript BAF.R -i inputfolder -o outputfolder -b bedfile -r -f
    Usage: BAF.R [-[-help|h]] [-[-input|i] <character>] [-[-ratioGraph|r]] [-[-BAFGraph|f]] [-[-output|o] <character>] [-[-bed|b] <character>]
    -h|--help          help manual
    -i|--input         filepath for *.BAF.txt
    -r|--ratioGraph    if RatioGraph should be drawn
    -f|--BAFGraph      if BAFGraph should be drawn
    -o|--output        filepath for output figures
    -b|--bed           panel bed file    


# Instructions
* For ratiaGraph, ratio.txt & CNV files generated by Control-FREEC have to be contained in the inputfolder.
* For BAFGraph, BAF.txt need to be provided. 
* The x-axis of the plot represents bases covered by the targeted regions.
